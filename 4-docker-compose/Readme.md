## Task 4: Docker Compose for Multi-Container Setup

Use Docker Compose to set up a multi-container environment.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines:
   - A Redis service
   - An Alpine service that depends on Redis
2. Use environment variables in the Compose file
3. Define a custom network for the services
4. Use the `command` option to run a custom command in the Alpine container
